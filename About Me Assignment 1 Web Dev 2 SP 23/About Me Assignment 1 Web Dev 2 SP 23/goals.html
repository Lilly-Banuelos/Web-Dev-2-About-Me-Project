            <p class="centerStuff"> <strong>So, why have I been at OTC so long?</strong> Honestly I had no idea what I wanted to do after graduating
                from Glendale High School here in Springfield. I tried out 4 different degree programs before falling in
                love with programming. I've been in the biology program (for pre-verterinary science), the teaching program,
                the art program, and general education. After finally settling on computer science, to my great surprise and horror, most
                of my credits didn't transfer to the program. However, I've found since then that this gave me the opportunity to make
                stronger, lasting connections in the community and beyond.
                </p>
                <P class="centerStuff">
                    <strong>The classes I've taken so far</strong>, at least specifically for this program, are Technology and digital Literacy (CIS-101), Intro to Programming (CIS-120),
                C# 1 (CIS-150), Website Development 1 (CIS-130), Data Structures (CSC-210), Database and Query (CIS-250), Trigonometry (MTH-131), and Calculus 1 (MTH-140).

                <P class="centerStuff">
                    <strong>I've had a limited amount of experience before</strong> programming at OTC. When I was in middle school,
                I joined the newly formed coding club and wrote my first program. An apple moved across the screen
                and a bite was taken out of it when clicked. Unfortunately the group didn't last more than a week since there
                were only two members. Despite being such a short time, I loved every bit of the experience and it inspired
                me to take my first coding class.
                </P>
                <P class="centerStuff">
                    <strong>Much like high school, I didn't have any plans after graduation</strong> for the longest time. However, last semester changed the vague idea of where I thought I might be going.
                I took a database class out in Branson at the Table Rock Lake campus (which I highly recommend doing if you can). There I was introduced
                to SQL and normalizing sets of data. It was fun for me since I really enjoy organizing things and making lists. I've decided to become
                a database administrator. In the mean time, I plan on making a side business creating custom websites for friends and families, learning how to professionally design video games,
                trying out 3D animations, and making a phone app.
